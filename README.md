# Puppet Enterprise 3-Node Environment
Includes a Puppet Master plus a Development and Production Node

NOTES:

This is the current PE 2019.2.2 support archive. Only use this PE for 2019.x.x work unless
you have a specific version need.

It should also be noted that I have had intermittent issues with Virtualbox/Vagrant/PE in this
configuration. Sometimes I can "vagrant up" and the instance stands up without issue. Other times
Virtualbox loses track of something or PE does.


If this happens to you, run `vagrant destroy` and destroy all the instances.
Then, run `vagrant up` again, and it usually works second time. Rarely,
I've had to do a third, but it _has_ happened. :)


In the rollup, I have:

CentOS Linux 7<br>
Puppet Master with Puppet Enterprise centos7-pe2019.2.2<br>
Puppet Agents 1-2, all customized to the following two environments:<br>
- development<br>
- production<br>
